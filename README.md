# HIDView
USB HID Debugging assistant

Because everyone USES HID for different purposes, so actually can not write a general HID debugging assistant, you have to write the corresponding codec according to their actual use, the code has a RAMDisk codec example, you can refer to this code to write their own codec

to run this software, you need python 2.7, pyqt4 and a usb backend (hidapi or pywinusb)
